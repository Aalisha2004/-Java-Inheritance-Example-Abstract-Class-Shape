Shape Inheritance Example in Java
This Java program demonstrates abstract classes and inheritance using a base class Shape and two subclasses: Triangle and Rectangle.

ðŸ”¹ Classes:
Shape: Abstract class with side, area, and perimeter. Declares calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter().

Triangle: Extends Shape, uses side and height. Calculates area and perimeter (assuming equilateral triangle).

Rectangle: Extends Shape, uses side (as length) and width. Calculates area and perimeter.

TestShape: Main class that creates and displays a triangle and a rectangle.

Traingle:
Area:3.0
Perimeter:9.0
Rectangle:
Area:6.0
Perimeter:10.0
